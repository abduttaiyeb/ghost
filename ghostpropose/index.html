		<h1>Hey Ghost,</h1>
		<p>I know you're angry but to conclude I am sure you got confused between 11th Dec and 12th Dec, but the date of proposal is 12th December 01:27 . Its been a year with the ring in your hand, and my <b> HEART </b> too. You might be wondering why dont I send or write any poems anymore, might have been that I am changed, why am I not caring as I used to be, why is my tone so high now, why am I not so "lovy dovy" anymore. Well to answer all them I just have a simple answer. I love you more than I used to. You might not feel it, but I always to convey that I do and I am unable to show you, my behaviour has changed maybe, because of responsibilities and stress at par, but your're my mountain peak where I feel peace and calm
	It feels like yesterday we were sitting in a room quietly holding hands, it is the sweetest time i've spent. In the past 365 days our life's LOLERCOTTER has been too crazzy, but I've never felt best when I open my wallet and see our picture, scroll up my gallery and see our pictures, re-read our chats and relive our conversations.
	It was my worst and best day when you said <b>YES</b> to my proposal, worst?? yes, I wanted it to be special, like how you make me feel everytime when I am stressed.
	I just have a simple poem for you 
		" Roses are Red, Blue is the Sea,
			  Your're my <b><a href="./s2/index.html">Ghost</a></b> and I am your <b><a href="./s2/index.html">Fuseboxji </b></a>"</p>
