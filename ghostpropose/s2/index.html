<p>Dear Ghost,</p>

<p>You're the writer of my greatest love story and with every page my heart grows larger as your words remind me how you complete me with ink that never dries
Manifesting
The more you think the more you manifest but it's not true in all cases
When we try to manifest the desires of our heart it may not be fulfilled all the time
The effort and prayer we do for the person we love although we try to manifest we are unable to fulfill our wish
Like heaven and hell don't meet but I believe if the ultimate power wants
us to be together no one can stop us from uniting
Even though you don't know I love you but I believe when our souls meet afterlife you will get to know how much I love you
This manifestation is a never ending process inspite of knowing we can't spend life together I still believe there is a cosmic connection between us
oh my beloved how I've longed for you for many lifetimes. Pining for the moment where your hand would touch mine again.
Some say you are my half in this modern world, I call you my existence.
breathing in unison across all time and space, even we can barely keep up this chase. How your body feels warm and your kisses are soft. Each embrace bringing me closer to that of which I know. Our story.<br>
Our time.<br>
I love you my Ghost</p>
<br>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>
<p>Fuseboxji</p>
